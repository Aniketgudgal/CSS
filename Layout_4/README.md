# Layout 4

A clean, responsive webpage layout example built with a single stylesheet and image assets. This folder contains a demo page, styles, icons and images to help you preview and adapt the layout for your own projects.

## Preview

Replace `img/screenshot.png` with your screenshot (or add the screenshot file there). Example preview:

![Layout 4 preview](img/screenshort.png)

## Contents

- `pages/index.html` — demo HTML page showcasing the layout.
- `css/index.css` — main stylesheet for layout and responsive rules.
- `icons/` — icon assets used by the demo (if any).
- `img/` — images used by the demo. Place your screenshot at `img/screenshot.png`.

## Usage

1. Open `pages/index.html` in a browser to view the demo.
2. Modify `css/index.css` to change colors, spacing, and responsive breakpoints.
3. Replace or add images inside the `img/` folder. The README preview expects `img/screenshot.png`.

## Customization Tips

- Colors & typography: edit the top of `css/index.css` (variables or root selectors).
- Layout: look for grid or flex containers in `css/index.css` to adjust column counts and gaps.
- Images: add appropriately sized images into `img/` and update paths in `pages/index.html`.

## Notes

- This is a static demo layout intended for prototyping or as a starting template.
- No build step is required — files are plain HTML/CSS and open directly in the browser.
