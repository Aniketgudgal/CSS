Available layout folders
------------------------

The repository contains several example folders demonstrating Grid and Flex techniques. Key folders include:

- **Grid examples:**
   - [grid_template_1](/grid_template_1/README.md) — basic multi-area grid demo (header, slider, content blocks, footer).
   - [grid_template_3](/grid_template_3/README.md) — contact/hero layout using named grid areas and a two-column contact section.
   - [grid_template_4](/grid_template_4/README.md) — one-column grid with nested header grid and hero background.

- **Flex examples:**
   - [Layout_Design_In_Flex](/Layout_Design_In_Flex/README.md) — multi-band page demonstrating nested flex containers and article cards.
   - [Layout_design](/Layout_design/README.md) — additional flex-based examples and page components.

Each example folder contains an `index.html`, stylesheets (usually in a `css/` folder), and images in an `img/` folder. Open the folder and view `index.html` in a browser (or use Live Server) to preview.

Adding screenshots
------------------

Many examples include preview images in their `img/` folders and README files. If you want me to add or replace screenshots for specific examples, tell me which folder(s) and provide the image(s) or confirm that placeholders are acceptable.
